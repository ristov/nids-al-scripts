NIDS active learning scripts
============================


Introduction
------------
This repository contains active learning scripts for NIDS alert data set from
https://github.com/ristov/nids-alert-data. The scripts require the presence
of the modAL framework: https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL.

The experiments conducted with the active learning scripts from this repository
have been described in the following paper:

Risto Vaarandi and Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares, 
"Network IDS alert classification with active learning techniques," 
Journal of Information Security and Applications, vol. 81, article 103687, 2024, 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2023.103687

The repository contains the following scripts:

al-traditional.py - active learning with traditional random sampling based seed and pool

al-outlierN.py - active learning with Outlier-N based seed and pool

al-committee-outlierN.py - QbC active learning with Outlier-N based seed and pool

al-rankedbatch-outlierN.py - ranked-batch active learning with Outlier-N based seed and pool

fully-supervised.py - fully supervised learning
